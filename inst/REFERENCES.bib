	abstract = {Long-term bedrock incision is driven by daily discharge events of variable magnitude and frequency, with ineffective events below an incision threshold. We explore theoretically how this short-term stochastic behavior controls long-term steady state incision rates and bedrock channel profiles, combining a realistic frequency-magnitude distribution of discharge with a deterministic, detachment-limited incision model in which incision rate is a power function of basal shear stress above a critical shear stress. Our model predicts a power law relationship between steady state slope and drainage area consistent with observations. The exponent of this power law is independent of discharge mean and variability, while the amplitude factor, which controls mountain belt relief, is a power law function of mean runoff (with an exponent of −0.5) and a complex function of runoff variability. In accordance with evidence that incision occurs between 6 and 20\% of time in rapidly incising rivers ({\textgreater}1 mm/yr) our model predicts that channel steepness is virtually insensitive to runoff variability. Runoff variability can only decrease channel steepness for very slow incision rates and/or weak lithologies. The relationship between channel steepness and incision rate is always a power law whose exponent depends on the channel cross-sectional geometry and runoff variability. This contradicts models neglecting discharge stochasticity in which the steepness-incision scaling is set by the incision law exponent. Our results suggest that changes in climate variability cannot explain an increase in bedrock incision rates during the Late Cenozoic within the context of a detachment limited model.},

	abstract = {Bedrock river incision occurs only during floods large enough to mobilize sediment and overcome substrate detachment thresholds. New data relating channel steepness and erosion rate provide the opportunity to evaluate the role of thresholds and discharge variability in landscape evolution. We augment an extensive erosion rate data set in the San Gabriel Mountains, California, with analysis of streamflow records and observations of channel width and sediment cover to evaluate the importance of climate and erosion thresholds on incision rates. We find the relationship between channel steepness and erosion rate in the San Gabriel Mountains can be explained using a simple stochastic-threshold incision model where the distribution of large floods follows an inverse power law, suggesting that details of incision mechanics, sediment effects, width adjustment, and debris flows do not significantly influence the steady state relationship between steepness and erosion rate. Using parameters tuned to this case, we vary climate parameters to explore a range of behavior for the steepness-erosion relationship. Erosion is enhanced by both increases in mean runoff and discharge variability. We explore the implications of an empirical relationship between mean runoff and variability to test whether dry, variable climates can erode more efficiently than wet, stable climates. For channels with high thresholds or low steepness, modeled erosion rate peaks at a mean runoff of 200–400 mm/yr. For much of the parameter space tested, erosion rates are predicted to be insensitive to increases in runoff above ∼500 mm/yr, with important implications for the hypothesized influence of climate on tectonics.},

	abstract = {Functional relationships between landscape morphology and denudation rate allow for the estimation of sediment fluxes using readily available topographic information. Empirical studies of topography-erosion linkages typically employ data with diverse temporal and broad spatial scales, such that heterogeneity in properties and processes may cloud fundamental process-scale feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and landscape development. Here, we use a previously proposed nonlinear model for sediment transport on hillslopes to formulate 1-D dimensionless functions for hillslope morphology as well as a generalized expression relating steady-state hillslope relief to erosion rate, hillslope transport parameters, and hillslope length. For study sites in the Oregon Coast Range and Gabilan Mesa, CA, model predictions of local relief and average hillslope gradient compare well with values derived from high-resolution topographic data acquired via airborne laser altimetry. Our formulation yields a nondimensional number describing the extent to which the nonlinearity in our gradient-flux model affects slope morphology and landscape response to tectonic and climatic forcing. These results should be useful for inferring rates of hillslope denudation and sediment flux from topography, or for coarse-scale landscape evolution simulations, in that first-order hillslope properties can be calculated without explicit modeling of individual hillslopes.},

	abstract = {We develop a simple stochastic theory for erosion and sediment transport, based on the Poisson pulse rainfall model, in order to analyze how variability in rainfall and runoff influences drainage basin evolution. Two cases are considered: sediment transport by runoff in rills and channels and particle detachment from bedrock or cohesive soils. Analytical and numerical results show that under some circumstances, rainfall variability can have an impact equal to or greater than that of mean rainfall amount. The predicted sensitivity to rainfall variability is greatest when (1) thresholds for runoff generation and/or particle detachment are significant and/or (2) erosion and transport are strong nonlinear functions of discharge. In general, sediment transport capacity is predicted to increase with increasing rainfall variability. Depending on the degree of nonlinearity, particle detachment capacity may either increase or decrease with increasing rainfall variability. These findings underscore the critical importance of hydrogeomorphic thresholds and other sources of nonlinearity in process dynamics. The morphologic consequences of rainfall variability are illustrated by incorporating the pulse rainfall theory into a landscape simulation model. The simulation results imply that, all else being equal, catchments experiencing a shift toward greater climate variability will tend to have (1) higher erosion rates, (2) higher drainage density (because of increased runoff erosion efficiency), and ultimately (3) reduced relief. The stochastic approach provides a useful method for incorporating physically meaningful climate data within the current generation of landscape evolution models.},

Theoretical arguments for both detachment- and transport-limited erosion regimes suggest that rock uplift rate should exert first-order control on this scaling. Here we describe in detail a method for exploiting this relationship, in which topographic indices of longitudinal profile shape and character are derived from digital topographic data. The stream profile data can then be used to delineate breaks in scaling that may be associated with tectonic boundaries. The description of the method is followed by three case studies from varied tectonic settings. The case studies illustrate the power of stream profile analysis in delineating spatial patterns of, and in some cases, temporal changes in, rock uplift rate. Owing to an incomplete understanding of river response to rock uplift, the method remains primarily a qualitative tool for neotectonic investigations; we conclude with a discussion of research needs that must be met before we can extract quantitative information about tectonics directly from topography.},

A substantial body of research in the past decade demonstrates that incising channel systems play a central role in setting relationships among topographic relief, differential rock uplift rate, and climatically modulated erosional efficiency. This review provides an introduction to the analysis and interpretation of channel profiles in erosional mountain ranges. We show that existing data support theoretical expectations of positive, monotonic relationships between channel steepness index, a measure of channel gradient normalized for downstream increases in drainage area, and erosion rate at equilibrium, and that the transient response to perturbations away from equilibrium engenders specific spatial patterns in channel profiles that can be used to infer aspects of the forcing. These aspects of channel behavior lay the foundation for a series of case studies that we use to illustrate how focused, quantitative analysis of channel morphology can provide insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of active deformation. Although the complexities of river response to climate, lithology, and uplift patterns mean that multiple interpretations of topographic data alone will always possible, we show that application of stream profile analysis can be a powerful reconnaissance tool with which to interrogate the rates and patterns of deformation in active mountain belts.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the application of high-resolution imagery and geographic-based information systems across every segment of society from security intelligence to product marketing to scientific research. Google Earth has positioned itself at the forefront of this spatial information wave by providing free access to high-resolution imagery through a simple, user-friendly interface. Whereas Google Earth imagery has been widely exploited across the earth sciences for spatial visualization, education, and place-based searches, few studies have utilized the high-resolution imagery to yield quantitative insights about the processes and mechanisms acting at the earth's surface. In this paper, we detail the benefits of the underlying high-resolution imagery available within Google Earth, review the limited published research to date, and utilize this imagery to quantitatively illuminate previously difficult and unresolved questions within the discipline of geomorphology involving: (1) channel-width variability and scaling relations in the tectonically active Himalaya; (2) landslide characteristics related to large magnitude climatic and tectonic events in Haiti; and (3) identification and quantification of laterally offset geomorphic features within eastern California. In each example, we compare analyses using freely available Google Earth imagery with standard imagery and techniques (e.g., Landsat, ASTER, lidar) to demonstrate the potential benefits of using high-spatial resolution Google Earth imagery over established methodologies. In addition, we discuss the potential limitations and problems with using the imagery currently available in Google Earth and propose favorable future applications, namely studies in remote terrains and those requiring high-resolution imagery across a large spatial extent, where purchasing such imagery in an academic environment would be cost-prohibitive. Whether as a supplement, for reconnaissance, or as the primary data set, high-resolution Google Earth imagery, when properly applied, holds great promise for quantitatively tackling previously unresolved problems in the study of earth surface processes.},

	abstract = {Soil-mantled hillslopes are typically convex near the crest and become increasingly planar downslope, consistent with nonlinear, slope-dependent sediment transport models. In contrast to the widely used linear transport model (in which sediment flux is proportional to slope angle), nonlinear models imply that sediment flux should increase rapidly as hillslope gradient approaches a critical value. Here we explore how nonlinear transport influences hillslope evolution and introduce a dimensionless parameter •Fr to express the relative importance of nonlinear transport. For steady state hillslopes, with increasing •Fr (i.e., as slope angles approach the threshold angle and the relative magnitude of nonlinear transport increases), the zone of hillslope convexity becomes focused at the hilltop and side slopes become increasingly planar. On steep slopes, rapid increases in sediment flux near the critical gradient limit further steepening, such that hillslope relief and slope angle are not sensitive indicators of erosion rate. Using a one-dimensional finite difference model, we quantify hillslope response to changes in baselevel lowering and/or climate-related transport efficiency and use an exponential decay function to describe how rapidly sediment flux and erosion rate approach equilibrium. The exponential timescale for hillslope adjustment decreases rapidly with increasing •Fr. Our results demonstrate that the adjustment timescale for hillslopes characteristic of the Oregon Coast Range and similar steep, soil-mantled landscapes is relatively rapid ({\textless} 50 kyr), less than one quarter of the timescale predicted by the linear transport model.},

	abstract = {A geomorphic transport law is a mathematical statement derived from a physical principle or mechanism, which expresses the mass flux or erosion caused by one or more processes in a manner that: 1) can be parameterized from field measurements, 2) can be tested in physical models, and 3) can be applied over geomorphically significant spatial and temporal scales. Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state. We propose that landscape evolution modeling can be broadly categorized into detailed, apparent, statistical and essential realism models and it is the latter, concerned with explaining mechanistically the essential morphodynamic features of a landscape, in which geomorphic transport laws are most effectively applied. A limited number of studies have provided verification and parameterization of geomorphic transport laws for: linear slope-dependent transport, non-linear transport due to dilational disturbance of soil, soil production from bedrock, and river incision into bedrock. Field parameterized geomorphic transport laws, however, are lacking for many processes including landslides, debris flows, surface wash, and glacial scour. We propose the use of high- resolution topography, as initial conditions, in landscape evolution models and explore the applicability of locally parameterized geomorphic transport laws in explaining hillslope morphology in the Oregon Coast Range. This modeling reveals unexpected morphodynamics, suggesting that the use of real landscapes with geomorphic transport laws may provide new insights about the linkages between process and form.},

	abstract = {Be-derived catchment average erosion rates from the Himalaya and Eastern Tibet show different relationships with normalized channel steepness index (ksn), suggesting differences in erosional efficiency of bedrock river incision. We used a stochastic-threshold stream power model (SPM) to explore to what extent this observation can be explained by differences in the mean and variability of discharge between the two regions. Based on the analysis of 199 daily discharge records (record lengths 3-45 years; average 18.5 years), we parameterized monsoonal discharge with a weighted sum of two inverse gamma distributions. During both high- and low-flow conditions, annual and inter-annual discharge variability is similarly low in each region. Channel widths for 36 rivers indicate, on average, 25\% wider streams in Eastern Tibet than in the Himalaya. Because most catchments with 10Be data are not gauged, we constrained mean annual discharge in these catchments using gridded precipitation data sets that we calibrated to the available discharge records. Comparing 10Be-derived with modeled erosion rates, the stochastic-threshold SPM explains regional differences better than a simple SPM based on drainage area or mean annual runoff. Systematic differences at small ksn values can be reconciled with ksn-dependent erosion thresholds, whereas substantial scatter for high ksn values persists, likely due to methodological limitations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that changes in the duration or strength of summer monsoon precipitation have the largest effect on erosional efficiency, while changes in monsoonal discharge variability have almost no effect. The modeling approach presented in this study can in principle be used to assess the impact of precipitation changes on erosion.},
